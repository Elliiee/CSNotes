    1 byte = 8 bits
    For characters, we use ASCII which are integers which can be converted to bits as well.

    NOT ~
    unary operator that flips the bits of number, 0 to 1, or 1 to 0

    AND &
    binary operator
    use on two equal length bit patterns
    if both bits are 1, it's 1, otherwise 0.

    OR |
    binary operator
    use on two equal-length bit patterns
    if either bit is 1, it's 1, otherwise 0

    XOR ^
    binary operator
    use on two equal length bit patterns
    if both bits are the same, it's 0, otherwise 1

    Left Shift <<
    binary operator
    shift to the left and append 0 at the end
    equals to = multiply with 2's square n

    Right Shift >>
    shift to the right and append 1 at the end
    equals to = divide with 2n
